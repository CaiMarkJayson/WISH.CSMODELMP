    "Heart failure is a persistent and progressive cardiovascular condition where in the heart is unable to pump the right amount of oxygenated blood through out the body. Lifestyle and other prevailing conditions of a person can affect their risk of having heart failure. Every year, 31% of the total deaths aroud the world is caused by cardiovascular diseases. As knowledge about these conditions broaden through the years, there are are a lot of factors that can help predict the posibility of heart failure to occur. With the help of modern tools, survival rate of people with heart disease, early detection of heart diseases and deeper understanding of these cnditions can transpire that may be of great help for future generations to have a healthier lives.\n",

    "The proponents of the notebook has found that features: age, time(follow up period), serum sodium, serum creatinine, and ejection fraction are the features that has the greatest effect with the occurence of heart failure. With this findings, the proponents have used these features and created a model that can predict whether there is a chance of heart failure to occur with a 90% accuracy result. This means that if these features are in a certain critical level, or value, heart failure may incur. \n",
    "\n",
    "The proponents has also found that serum creatinine and ejection fraction are 2 features that are critical for human survival. The proponents found that patients who did not die from heart failure have serum creatinine levels from 0.9979 to 1.4400 mg/dL and ejection fraction of 37.2829 to 44.9670% with 95% confidence level. Furthermore, for patients who have passed away due to heart failure have serum creatinine levels of 1.3750 to 2.5115 mg/dL, and ejection fraction  of 29.0104 to 35.5895% with 95% confidence interval. Compared to the normal level of serum creatine of 0.84 to 1.21 mg/dL the levels of both the patients who survived and passed away are significantly higher than the normal level. For the normal ejection fraction, the heart should pump 50-70% of blood out of the heart but based on the results, both the hearts of the people who survied and passed away pumped remarkably lower percentage of blood out of their heart. This means that their blood is not circulating enough oxygenated blood throughout the body affecting their other organs such as the kidneys which in based on their serum creatinine levels are not functioning well. \n",

    "Data models like these can be beneficial for the field of medicine where healthcare practitioners to see different factors in which the patients incur heart failure. It may also open doors for further research and cure development for the future.\n",

    "These information are valuable not only for the field of medicine but also for the general public for reliable and accessible information. It is important for the general public to be more informed with these findings for them to ensure their personal safety and for them to mantain their general health."
